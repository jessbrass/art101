					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I started by using jQuery for the click listener, but when I couldn't figure out 
                        how to get it to work, I turned to the javascript in the assignment. When 
                        that was not working either, I asked ChatGPT what might be going on. ChatGPT 
                        was thorough in its explanations as usual, but it didn't help. I eventually 
                        asked my TA Ilia for help and he told me that the jQuery I had been previously
                        trying to implement only had a few issues and would work smoother, so he corrected
                        the few errors in my jQuery and it worked! Then I messed around with the CSS until
                        I was happy with the assignment.</p>
