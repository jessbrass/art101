					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I struggled a bit with figuring out why my code was not working.
                        I followed the class instructions for what we did in JS bin, but 
                        my code would not run. After asking chatGPT for help I realized
                        I had just written some things slightly off and corrected them. </p>
