			<h1>Lab 9 - Libraries and JQuery</h1>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a lot of fun with the CSS in this lab. I used the website Coolor.co
                        to find nice color palettes. I struggled to figure out to make a button do something,
                        and then I made a button that changed the background color but that was the wrong button function
                        for the lab. And then I struggled to make a button toggle a Class. 
                        </p>

                <p>The results are right down below.</p>

        <div class="special">
            <p> This is my special class for going crazy in CSS. I experimented by 
                scrolling through the  different prompted </br> options and seeing what worked. 
                So far, CSS is my favorite thing I've learned in this class. </br>
