// Sewing up a hole in your shirt: [this may be more complex with certain fabrics/materials]
  //Thread the needle:
      // Choose your color of thread. 
      // Determine the length (if unsure, start with 4-5 feet).
      // Put the string through the eye of your needle. 
        // Struggling? Wetting the end of the thread helps.
      // Thread the string halfway through and fold it in half
      // Tie the two ends together

  // Sewing a stitch:  *Note: Make the stitches on the INSIDE of the shirt, the part that will not be seen.*
      // Poke a hole through your two pieces of fabric.
      // Bring the thread all the way through.
      // Poke another hole right next to the first hole.
      // Thread your thread all the way through, making sure not to let any excess thread get caught in the loop you just made.
      // You have made a stitch! Repeat!

  // If your thread runs out:
      // Cut the thread from the needle
      // Thread another needle (refer to "Thread the needle" until the last step)
      // Instead of tying the two ends together, tie them to your original string. 

  // To finish:
      // Make sure you have at least 2.5 inches of thread left.
      // Begin making a stitch.
      // Before the loop closes, thread your needle through the loop and close the stitch around the thread.
      // Do this at least twice for extra security.
      // Cut your thread from the needle.
    // Done!

  // initialize the game board
  // create a board with 2 rows of 6 pits each (12 pits total)
  // Place 4 stones in each pit
  // While the game is not over:
      // display the current state of the board
      // ask the current player to choose a pit (1-6) on their side.

      // Pick up all the stones from the chosen pit.
      // Distribute the stones one by one, moving counterclockwise and skipping the opponent's store.
      // If the last stone lands in the current player's store, they get another turn.
      // If the last stone lands in an empty pit on the player's side, they capture that stone and any stone in the opposite pit.
      // Add any captured stones to the player's store.

      // Check if one player's pits are all empty. If so, the game is over.

      // Switch to the other player

    // Determine the winner:
      //Compare the number of stones in each player's store.
      // The player with more stones in their store wins.
