	// Sewing a stitch:  *Note: Make the stitches on the INSIDE of the shirt, the part that will not be seen.*
		// Poke a hole through your two pieces of fabric.
		// Bring the thread all the way through.
		// Poke another hole right next to the first hole.
		// Thread your thread all the way through, making sure not to let any excess thread get caught in the loop you just made.
		// You have made a stitch! Repeat!
			  
	// If your thread runs out:
		// Cut the thread from the needle
		// Thread another needle (refer to "Thread the needle" until the last step)
		// Instead of tying the two ends together, tie them to your original string. 
			  
	// To finish:
		// Make sure you have at least 2.5 inches of thread left.
		// Begin making a stitch.
		// Before the loop closes, thread your needle through the loop and close the stitch around the thread.
		// Do this at least twice for extra security.
		// Cut your thread from the needle.
	// Done!

// Mancala
// An implementation of the game
// Jessie Brass (jbrass@ucsc.edu)
// October 2023
	// initialize the game board
	// create a board with 2 rows of 6 pits each (12 pits total)
	// Place 4 stones in each pit
	// While the game is not over:
		// display the current state of the board
		// ask the current player to choose a pit (1-6) on their side.

		// Pick up all the stones from the chosen pit.
		// Distribute the stones one by one, moving counterclockwise and skipping the opponent's store.
		// If the last stone lands in the current player's store, they get another turn.
		// If the last stone lands in an empty pit on the player's side, they capture that stone and any stone in the opposite pit.
		// Add any captured stones to the player's store.

	// Check if one player's pits are all empty. If so, the game is over.

	// Switch to the other player

	// Determine the winner:
		//Compare the number of stones in each player's store.
		// The player with more stones in their store wins.

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> Pseudocode two different types of processes: a unique everyday task, and a simple game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I struggled a bit with the CSS. I tried to change the font family of the heading using class h1 in my CSS file 
						but it didn't work. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> My results are pretty solid and thorough. I think my Pseudocode makes sense and includes everything it needs.
						I used ChatGPT for the Mancala Pseudocode. I hope to comtinue to better understand CSS.
