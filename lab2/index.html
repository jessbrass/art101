	<h1> Hello World!

	<div class="minor-section">
	<h2>Here is a little about me and my life recently: </h2>
		<p> My name is Jessie and I am junior film and literature double major. I just applied to the creative writing concentration
		and I will find out if I got in this Friday. I'm nervous that I won't get in, I ended up having to cut my story in half 
		because I made the fatal mistake of writing in 11 point font instead of 12 point font and it was 944 words over the word
		count an hour before I had to turn it in so I just had to delete the second half. <br/>
		Recently, my life has been pretty busy because I just started a new job at The Mystery Spot as a tour guide and I am co-producing 
		for the Film Production Coalition's (FPC) magical realism short film. My job is pretty fun and I enjoy co-producing but it has been very
		time consuming. Today, I worked from 10am to 2pm, then had class from 3:20 to 6:20, and then my Art 101 section from 7:10 t0 8:15. 
		I am looking forward to next week because Kimya Dawson is playing in Santa Cruz and I am going to see her perform. <br/>
		<p>More things that have happened recently:</p>
			<ul>
					<li>This past weekend, I went to the antique fair and got some spider-shaped candle holders, a cool new tank top with a skeleton on it,
						a cool ring (but it broke yesterday), and two new necklaces. I keep forgetting to go to the antique fair so I'm glad I got to go.</li>
					<li>Last night, I had a meeting with the FPC producers and co-producers to assign roles for our short film groups. We had the meeting at Woodstocks, the pizza place downtown next to Trader Joe's. I got one of their
						sandwiches for the first time. It was okay, but I think they should stick to pizza. </li>
					<li>Over the summer, I went on a road trip across the country. We flew to New Jersey to meet up with a friend to bring their car back to Santa Cruz. 
						We stopped in Toledo, Des Moines, Boulder, Salt Lake City, and Reno. We made pretty good time, we crossed the country in about a week.
						 We spent the most time in New York, Chicago and Boulder.</li>
					</ul>
